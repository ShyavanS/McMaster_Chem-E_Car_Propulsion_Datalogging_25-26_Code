# McMaster_Chem-E_Car_Propulsion_Datalogging_25-26_Code
A datalogging codebase for the McMaster Chem-E Car Team Propulsion Sub-Team.

This project uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller programmed in the Arduino programming language. A simple setup for them to gather data for their reaction by hijacking an HP 3435A multimeter to add serial output and datalogging capability. All data is output via serial to Excel Data Streamer.

The major components used are as follows:<br />
1 - HP 3435A Multimeter (for monitoring reaction power output)<br />
1 - Arduino UNO Microcontroller<br />

The main objective of the competition is to design a small car to carry a certain amount of weight a set distance while powering and stopping the vehicle with a chemical reaction. The distance and weight vary each year. The compectition is hosted by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). See the corresponding repository for the current year's car codebase for more information on this year's setup.
